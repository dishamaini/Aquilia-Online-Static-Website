        <p class="sectionSubTag txt-small">With millions of offerings to choose from, Aquilio has evolved from a small bookstore to a mammoth internet presence. 
            The company not only brings you millions of items from its own warehouses but also from sellers all over the world who can upload their own wares for sale.
            That makes it possible for you to compare prices at a glance from a host of stores and individual sellers.
            If you're looking for a collectible, this is the first shopping website you should check, but you'll also find brand-new items.
            You can use a variety of filters such as brand, price, size, color, features, and consumer ratings 
            and reviews to sift through your search results.

        <p class="sectionTag txt-big">A change you can see</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag txt-small">Aquilio is a global marketplace that offers goods from incredibly talented artisans around the world.
            You won't find the latest blockbuster movie on Etsy, but you can certainly find innovative crafts made by people
            in their homes that you can purchase to express your inner geek/fan/artist.
            Aquilio is also a great way for people who craft marketable items to make a little money on the side; setting up your own storefront on Etsy is easy and provides a lot of potential exposure. 
            Like these other shopping sites, Aquilio is available from the Etsy app and the desktop website.
